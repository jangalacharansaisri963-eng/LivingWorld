# Living World — Minecraft Java Edition Mod

**Living World** is a production-quality Minecraft Java Edition mod built on the **Fabric** toolchain. Its primary goal is to make Minecraft feel like a living world that remembers events, reacts to players, develops changing behaviors, and produces believable emergent situations — enhancing vanilla Minecraft rather than replacing it.

## Key Features

1. **Short-Term Mob Memory & Trauma Decay**:
   - Entities form individual memory records when damaged or when spotting threats.
   - Memories retain location, intensity, and decay progressively over 60 seconds (configurable).
2. **Individual Mob Traits & Personalities**:
   - Mobs possess innate personalities (`SKITTISH`, `AGGRESSIVE`, `GUARDIAN`, `CURIOUS`, `STOIC`).
   - Traits influence fleeing thresholds, pursuit vigor, and assist ranges.
3. **Group Dynamics & Ally Alerts**:
   - When attacked, mobs broadcast panic/distress signals to nearby kindred within 16 blocks.
   - Throttled alerting prevents cascade storms.
4. **Dynamic Village Vigilance & Iron Golem Mobilization**:
   - Villages maintain dynamic safety states: `PEACEFUL`, `ALERT`, `DEFENSIVE`, `COMPROMISED`.
   - Iron Golems actively dispatch to reported breach positions.
5. **Player Karma & Regional Reputation**:
   - Defending villagers and slaying hostiles earns karma ("Hero of the Realm", "Trusted Friend").
   - Slaughtering villagers or peaceful wildlife incurs severe karma penalties ("Feared Outlaw", "Notorious Marauder").
   - Saved across server restarts using Minecraft 1.21.1 `SavedData.Factory` and `CompoundTag` NBT storage.
6. **Wildlife Ecology & Weather Sensitivity**:
   - Animals detect rain and thunderstorms and actively seek tree canopies and overhangs.
7. **In-Game Brigadier Commands**:
   - `/livingworld status`: Check active tracked memories and emergent world situations.
   - `/livingworld reputation`: Inspect your karma level and titles.
   - `/livingworld events`: Browse historical battles and notable world events.
